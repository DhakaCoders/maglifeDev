                        information (such as a
                        credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The
                        personal information collected from Subscribers during the registration process is used to
                        manage each Subscriber's account (such as for billing purposes).This information may be used by
                        us for service, editorial, or marketing purposes or shared with third parties, as stated herein,
                        or in special circumstances, including without limitation, vendors who assist us with the
                        preparation and mailing of our editorial and marketing communications, with order fulfillment
                        facilities, and with our sponsors and partners for the purpose of contacting you with news about
                        relevant products or publications.

                        provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Subscribers). As

                        sell advertisements that appear on the Services. At times we may send an advertisement for a
                        third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds.
